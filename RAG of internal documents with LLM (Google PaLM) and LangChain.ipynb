    "## Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "With plenty of OpenAI's implementations (e.g. text-embedding-3-small), this one implements Google PaLM's text-bison@002 with LangChain. \n",
    "\n",
    "The example is to build a Question Answering system, with prompt engineering (of course) + augmenting the LLM's knowledge with data sources such as documents curated internally. \n",
    "\n",
    "Specifically, the Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) is based on a private collection of documents (sample of Google published research papers stored on gs://github-repo/documents/google-research-pdfs/). \n",
    "\n",
    "Furthermore, it prevents hallucination in two ways:\n",
    "1. Provide answers with references to the sources \n",
    "2. Say \"I don't know\" rather than hallucination, such as in the case of being asked \"what is NFC\" where no information is provided in the documents, the system shall not hallucinate. \n",
    "\n",
    "## Steps\n",
    "Ingest knowledge-base sources into a vector store:\n",
    "1. Read the documents, in this case, PDF files\n",
    "2. Chunk the documents, to include relevant parts of the document as context to the prompt\n",
    "3. Generate embeddings for each chunked document\n",
    "4. Add embedding to the vector store\n",
    "\n",
    "When user enters a prompt:\n",
    "1. Raise the question \n",
    "2. Generate embedding for the user prompt \n",
    "3. Search the vector store to retrieve the nearest embeddings (relevant documents) closer to the prompt\n",
    "4. Fetch the actual text for the retrieved embeddings to add as context to the user's prompt\n",
    "5. Add the retrieved documents as context to the user's prompt\n",
    "6. Send the updated prompt to the LLM\n",
    "7. Return a summarized response to the user with references to the sources from the knowledge base\n",
    "\n",
    "## Implementation \n",
    "1. Google's PaLM API through Vertex AI with LangChain RetrievalQA \n",
    "2. Extract text from PDF files, as stored on Cloud Storage bucket\n",
    "3. Generate embeddings \n",
    "4. Vector Search (previously Vertex AI Matching Engine - and, hehe, Google hasn't completed re-branding)\n",
    "5. Query and return relevant results\n",
    "6. Google PaLM API for Text as LLM to synthesize results and respond to the user query"

In the original Localized Narratives [40], annota- tors speak and move their mouse simultaneously on an im- age, thus grounding each word with a mouse trace segment. However, this is challenging on a video. Our new protocol empowers annotators to tell the story of a video with Local- ized Narratives, capturing even complex events involving multiple actors interacting with each other and with sev- eral passive objects. We annotated 20k videos of the OVIS, UVO, and Oops datasets, totalling 1.7M words. Based on this data, we also construct new benchmarks for the video narrative grounding and video question answering tasks, and provide reference results from strong baseline models. Our annotations are available at https://google. github.io/video-localized-narratives/.', metadata={'source': 'genai-423417-documents/google-research-pdfs', 'document_name': 'connecting-vision-and-language-with-video-localized-narratives.pdf', 'chunk': 1154}),\n",
       " Document(page_content='Vision and language is a very active research area, which experienced much exciting progress recently [1, 32, 42, 43, 52]. At the heart of many developments lie datasets con- necting still images to captions, while grounding some of the words in the caption to regions in the image, made with a variety of protocols [6,21,24,26,33,38,40,48,50,60]. The recent Localized Narratives (ImLNs) [40] offer a particu- larly attractive solution: the annotators describe an image with their voice while simultaneously moving their mouse over the regions they are describing. Speaking is natural and efﬁcient, resulting in long captions that describe the whole scene. Moreover, the synchronization between the voice and mouse pointer yields dense visual grounding for every word. Yet, still images only show one instant in time. Anno- tating videos would be even more interesting, as they show entire stories, featuring a ﬂow of events involving multiple actors and objects interacting with each other.', metadata={'source': 'genai-423417-documents/google-research-pdfs', 'document_name': 'connecting-vision-and-language-with-video-localized-narratives.pdf', 'chunk': 1158})]"

      "We propose Video Localized Narratives, a new form of multimodal video annotations connecting vision and lan- guage. In the original Localized Narratives [40], annota- tors speak and move their mouse simultaneously on an im- age, thus grounding each word with a mouse trace segment. However, this is challenging on a video. Our new protocol empowers annotators to tell the story of a video with Local- ized Narratives, capturing even complex events involving multiple actors interacting with each other and with sev- eral passive objects. We annotated 20k videos of the OVIS, UVO, and Oops datasets, totalling 1.7M words. Based on this data, we also construct new benchmarks for the video narrative grounding and video question answering tasks, and provide reference results from strong baseline models. Our annotations are available at https://google. github.io/video-localized-narratives/.\n",

      "Vision and language is a very active research area, which experienced much exciting progress recently [1, 32, 42, 43, 52]. At the heart of many developments lie datasets con- necting still images to captions, while grounding some of the words in the caption to regions in the image, made with a variety of protocols [6,21,24,26,33,38,40,48,50,60]. The recent Localized Narratives (ImLNs) [40] offer a particu- larly attractive solution: the annotators describe an image with their voice while simultaneously moving their mouse over the regions they are describing. Speaking is natural and efﬁcient, resulting in long captions that describe the whole scene. Moreover, the synchronization between the voice and mouse pointer yields dense visual grounding for every word. Yet, still images only show one instant in time. Anno- tating videos would be even more interesting, as they show entire stories, featuring a ﬂow of events involving multiple actors and objects interacting with each other.\n",

These datasets cover a general domain, as opposed to only cook- ing [10, 66] or ﬁrst-person videos [16]. Moreover, these videos contain complex scenes with interactions between multiple actors and passive objects, leading to interesting stories that are captured by our rich annotations. In to- tal our annotations span 20k videos, 72k actors, and 1.7 million words. On average, each narrative features tran- scriptions for 3.5 actors, totaling 75.1 words, including 23.0 nouns, 9.5 verbs, and 8.5 adjectives (Fig. 4).

In the original Localized Narratives [40], annota- tors speak and move their mouse simultaneously on an im- age, thus grounding each word with a mouse trace segment. However, this is challenging on a video. Our new protocol empowers annotators to tell the story of a video with Local- ized Narratives, capturing even complex events involving multiple actors interacting with each other and with sev- eral passive objects. We annotated 20k videos of the OVIS, UVO, and Oops datasets, totalling 1.7M words. Based on this data, we also construct new benchmarks for the video narrative grounding and video question answering tasks, and provide reference results from strong baseline models.

The recent Localized Narratives (ImLNs) [40] offer a particu- larly attractive solution: the annotators describe an image with their voice while simultaneously moving their mouse over the regions they are describing. Speaking is natural and efﬁcient, resulting in long captions that describe the whole scene. Moreover, the synchronization between the voice and mouse pointer yields dense visual grounding for every word. Yet, still images only show one instant in time.

However, despite the perceived importance of various individual attributes and characteristics of annotators, very few of these factors were utilised in the recruitment process (see table 2). For instance, only 4 out of 15 practitioners who considered gender to be a relevant criterion included it in their selection criteria. Furthermore, even when additional information on annotator char- acteristics was available, it was rarely utilised in the recruitment process (table 2, column ‘Available Information’).

      "4.2 Approaches to Annotator Diversity Below, we capture the varied perspectives to annotator diversity among the participants in our study, from some who considered diversity as irrelevant, to others who made efforts to accommodate it, even if only in partial ways. Most practitioners acknowledged the role of annotator subjectivities in the annotation process; some emphasised the importance of diversity in achieving a balanced view and bringing previously overlooked sub-populations into con- sideration. However, many went on to explain their decisions to not consider annotator diversity in setting up annotation tasks. Their primary focus was on achieving a certain level of quality, which was often measured against how closely an annotator followed pre- defined parameters and guidelines. We discuss the justifications provided by practitioners for taking a representationalist approach to annotator diversity and prioritising measures of quality.\n",
      "\n",
      "4.3 Barriers to Incorporating Diversity In our study, participants identified several challenges to accommo- dating annotator diversity. Firstly, participants reported a lack of access to information about annotators, hindering their ability to understand and account for annotators’ unique perspectives and backgrounds. Additionally, the limited communication and collabo- ration between practitioners and annotators resulted in practition- ers having minimal knowledge of annotators beyond their worker identification (worker-ID). Lastly, the lack of clear and actionable pathways to incorporate annotator socio-demographic information into the development and evaluation process further diminished\n",

Researchers have argued that collecting more diverse data for rele- vant dimensions could lead to fairer ML models [8]. Fazelpour and De-Arteaga [28] emphasised the ways in which diversity-related considerations are embedded throughout the design of ML systems, regardless of whether they are actively recognised [28]. We con- tribute to this area of research by focusing on the conceptions of diversity within data annotator pools.\n",

      "Analysis. We computed a range of descriptive statistics using SPSS to better understand practitioners’ approaches to diversity, and particularly the kinds of diversity they view as relevant, if at all. These included descriptives to questions presented with Likert scale response options and multiple choice answers (e.g., the chal- lenges in recruiting the desired pool of annotators). We focused on comparing the differences between the attributes which were used to recruit annotators, the kinds of information available to practitioners and what they would see as relevant attributes in the ideal scenario. In cases where questions were completed by a subset of the respondents, we report question-specific response rates and percentage of respondents who answered that question. Finally, we conducted a qualitative analysis to the open-ended questions following the same to the interviews (see the following section 3.2 below)\n",
      "\n",
      "Additionally, our interviews revealed significant contrast be- tween participants’ reflections on the concept of annotator diver- sity and its actual implementation. Annotator diversity was often understood as representative of a particular perspective or point of view. For example, annotators were selected based on the low- resource dialect they spoke or the high flood risk areas they lived in, using language and location as proxies for diversity. Very few participants actively recruited annotators based on their lived ex- periences, knowledge, or expertise as facets of diversity.

In this research, we focused on AI practitioners in order to understand their conceptions of annotator diversity [68].

To cal- ibrate a microsimulation, one first needs to fix all the network issues (Section 7.1). Then, OD demand can be calibrated without simulation by matching the total counts of vehicles entering or exiting the network (Section 7.2) followed by calibration with macrosimulation by matching all detector counts in the network (Section 7.3). Once the OD demand is calibrated in this manner and after having chosen a route choice model (Section 7.4), the driving behaviors are then calibrated (Section 7.5) using a genetic algorithm (Section 7.6). The OD demand calibration and driving behavior calibration procedures can be reproduced from the provided open-source code4.\n",

The first phase of calibration is done without simulation by matching simulated and ground total counts of vehicles entering or exiting the network. This is then followed up by the second phase of calibration, done through macrosimulation. Once the OD demand is calibrated, the driving behaviors (routing, car- following, lane-changing models), and microsimulation parameters (like simulation time step) can be calibrated using optimization algorithms that work with expensive function evaluations (this work uses a genetic algorithm that is highly parallelizable).\n",

      "When using a contrastive learning method such as SimCLR (Chen et al., 2020a) for representation learning, the ﬁrst step is to specify the distribution of original examples z ∼ p(Z) within some space Z along with a sampler of augmented views p(A|Z = z) over a potentially different space A. 1 For example, p(Z) might represent a dataset of natural images, and p(A|Z) a random transformation that applies random scaling and color shifts. Contrastive learning then consists of ﬁnding a parameterized mapping (such as a neural network) which maps multiple views of the same image (e.g. draws from a1, a2 ∼ p(A|Z = z) for a ﬁxed z) close together, and unrelated views far apart. This mapping can then be used to deﬁne a representation which is useful for downstream supervised learning.\n",

      "As shown in Figure 1, we can thus reinterpret the three contrastive learning methods in Table 1 as kernel learning methods, in that they produce parameterized positive-deﬁnite kernel functions which approximate this positive-pair kernel. By investigating properties of this kernel, we can thus hope to build a better understanding of the behavior of contrastive learning.\n",
      "\n",
      "The success of these representations have led to a variety of theoretical analyses of contrastive learning, including analyses based on conditional independence within latent classes (Saunshi et al., 2019), alignment of hyperspherical embeddings (Wang & Isola, 2020), conditional independence structure with landmark embeddings (Tosh et al., 2021), and spectral analysis of an augmentation graph (HaoChen et al., 2021). Each of these analyses is based on a single choice of contrastive learning objective. In this work, we go further by integrating multiple popular contrastive learning methods into a single framework, and showing that it can be used to build minimax-optimal representations under a straightforward assumption about similarity of labels between positive pairs.\n",

      "We conclude by studying the behavior of contrastive learning models on two synthetic tasks for which the exact positive-pair kernel is known, and investigating the extent to which the basis of eigenfunctions can be extracted from trained models. As predicted by our theory, we ﬁnd that the same eigenfunctions can be recovered from multiple model parameterizations and losses, although the accuracy depends on both kernel parameterization expressiveness and augmentation strength.\n",

      "We note that applying a rotation matrix to the optimal representation does not affect the expressivity of that representation. It is thus sufﬁcient to identify the subspace spanned by the ﬁrst d principal component projection functions. If the representation dimension d is known in advance, it may be possible to adjust the contrastive learning method to accomplish this without requiring a separate PCA step. In particular, when using the spectral contrastive loss with a d-dimensional linear kernel head, the population minimizer of the loss will exactly correspond to the best d-dimensional approximation of K+. This means that the output layer representation will be exactly the set of principal component projection functions rotated by some orthogonal matrix.\n",

      "Indeed, such a minimizer is equivalent to K+ except that it scales the inner product by the value of b(a) for each communicating class. It is still possible to extract the set of Markov chain eigenfunctions from the set of principal components of this kernel, although one must correct for the scaling factor when computing the eigenvalues; see Appendix C.4 for details. Alternatively, one can ensure a unique minimum by combining the NT-Xent/InfoNCE loss with either the spectral or logistic losses (discussed below).\n",

We must think about productiv- ity both in the short term and the long term; for example, we need to understand the effects that biases against underrepresented groups have on developer productivity in terms of getting code submitted and also on retaining skilled employees by treating them fairly and affording them the same opportunities that others enjoy.\n",

Additionally, suc- cess in these activities is measur- able and unambiguously understood. More coal shoveled is better than less coal shoveled (strictly from a coal-shoveling-productivity point of view).

We see evidence that this effect does not happen because a developer sits idly by, waiting for the build to complete.

If a build is too slow, a developer will make a very human decision and context switch away to a new task. The developer will also take longer to resume the task when he or she switches back because of the need to regain the context of the task. • Developers, as humans, are sub- ject to unconscious biases that may affect how they interact\n",

First, developers strongly prefer that their humanity is acknowledged and re- spected (a key indicator of their hu- manity, in fact, is their preference for others to recognize it). Second, if we want to understand what makes devel- opers more or less productive, we need to understand what makes humans more or less productive, with software development as a special case.\n",

      "Software Developers Are Humans Software developers are humans. All of them. It seems that this should be an uncontroversial assertion. Indeed, when we assert it, no one ever dis- agrees. And yet, we find ourselves making this assertion on a regular ba- sis. Why? Because despite wide agree- ment with the assertion itself, many people behave as though developers were not humans, but rather nonhu- man components in a larger system— cogs in a machine, if you will.\n",

      "Software Engineering Is a Complex, Creative Endeavor One good reason that we continue to employ humans as software develop- ers, despite all of the messiness de- scribed previously, is that humans are good creative problem solvers. Engi- neering is an inherently creative en- deavor in that it involves finding novel solutions to complex problems. Not every solution is novel, and not every problem is complex, of course, but applying known solutions to simple problems doesn’t really require “engi- neering” in any meaningful sense.\n",

      "Software engineering is not algorithmic: There is no pre- scribed set of steps that will take one from having no function- ing code to having functioning code.

This isn’t to say that there are no factors that specifically affect software developers more than they affect other humans. Flaky tests, build speeds, and technical debt are domain-specific phenomena that have lots to do with software devel- opment as an activity.

Yet we don’t see any difference between the two: “tech- nical problems” frequently require understanding human decision-mak- ing processes and performance, and “human problems” can sometimes be addressed by technical solutions. Consider some examples of how they intertwine.\n",

In this work we aim to utilize the few-shot gen- eralization abilities exhibited by large language models (LLMs) (Brown et al., 2020; Chowdh- ery et al., 2022; Scao et al., 2022) for bootstrap- ping semantic parsing datasets across ﬁfty lan- guages. We propose a recipe of using LLMs to translate an English semantic parsing dataset containing (utterance, logical-form) pairs: Deng = {(xi eng, yi eng)} into a corresponding dataset in a target language: Dtgt = {(xi tgt, yi tgt)}. The gen- erated dataset Dtgt is then used to train a semantic parser in the target language. Our method uses a small amount of manually translated semantic parsing examples to teach the LLM how to trans- late English examples in the target language via in-context learning (Min et al., 2022).\n",

      "Figure 1: Proposed semantic parsing data translation pipeline using LLMs (§ 3): With the help of human translators, we ﬁrst collect translations of a small seed set of English examples in the Target Language (e.g. Hindi; § 3.1). Given a new English example, a small subset from this initial seed set of examples with their respective translations is chosen to prompt the LLM (§ 3.2). The prompted LLM translates the given English example in the Target Language. We repeat this process for each example in the English training data to generate a training dataset in the Target Language. To ensure high-quality of the resulting dataset, we generate diverse translations via top-p (nucleus) sampling (§ 3.3) and apply consistency ﬁltering (§ 3.4).\n",

(2021) implement the project step by training a ﬁller module on English data to ﬁll slot-values in a logical-form signature by copying spans from the utterance. During inference, the trained ﬁller module is then used in a zero-shot manner to ﬁll logical-form signatures with spans copied from the translated utterances.\n",

We then present an analysis of different design choices that result in effective data translation using LLM-T (§ 5.3). Finally, we present an error analysis to show the key sources of disagreements between the parser predictions and the ground truth (§ 5.4).

      "Despite cross-lingual generalization demon- strated by pre-trained multilingual models, the translate-train paradigm of transferring En- glish datasets across multiple languages re- mains to be a key mechanism for training task- speciﬁc multilingual models. However, for many low-resource languages, the availability of a reliable translation service entails signiﬁ- cant amounts of costly human-annotated trans- lation pairs. Further, translation services may continue to be brittle due to domain mismatch between task-speciﬁc input text and general- purpose text used for training translation mod- els.

Manual annotation of queries with their logical forms requires human expertise which makes data collection across multiple languages challenging. A common approach to automatic multilingual dataset creation is translating existing English datasets into target languages.
