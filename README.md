# Real $$$: Gen(AI)-Up Enterprises Applications, with tremendous upside ahead. 

## Random Musing
How fast we are moving, from vector-search with Nearest-neighbor https://github.com/johnzhu-ai/Vector-Search-and-Nearest-Neighbor, to fuse GenAI into Enterprise product catalog with OpenAI (text-embedding-3-small) vs. Google (textembedding-gecko) and LangChain (below) and RAG of internal documents (also below). And this leads to ... 

## Significant upgrade-cycle/market-space
As, virtually all enterprises will need to do 3-things: 
1.	Fuse ChatGPT/LLM onto Enterprises' legacy, relational-database driven applications, so as to answer “do you have a toy set that teaches numbers and letters to kids, and cost between $10-50?” (with LLM handle the first part, SQL-query the second portion, then synthesize the response) 
2.	Chatbot-on-steroid: RAG of internal documents/content/knowledge, to provide much accurate answers (instead of hallucination) – but also the "Fact Packs"
3.	Going forward, Enterprise application development itself will undergo a paradigm shift with LLM-augmentations.

Google stack technology is used, as I am a Google Certified ML Engineer.
